# CMPSC 441 AI Class Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects completed for the CMPSC 441 Artificial Intelligence course. The projects cover a range of AI topics and algorithms, implemented in Python.

## Project Descriptions

### Project 1: Problem Solving and Search

This project explores basic problem-solving and search algorithms. It includes implementations of:

*   **Basic Search Algorithms:** Depth-first search and breadth-first search for any-path problem solving.
*   **Coin Puzzle:** Solves a coin puzzle where you need to make a specific amount using a given set of coins.
*   **N-Queens Problem:** Solves the classic N-Queens problem, placing N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.
*   **Graph Problem:**  Implements search algorithms on graph structures.

### Project 2: Heuristic Search

This project focuses on heuristic search algorithms, including:

*   **Best-First Search:**  A search algorithm that prioritizes nodes based on a heuristic function.
*   **Uniform-Cost Search:** A search algorithm that prioritizes nodes based on their path cost.
*   **N-Queens Problem (Heuristic):**  Solves the N-Queens problem using heuristic search.
*   **Graph Problem (Heuristic):**  Implements heuristic search algorithms on graph structures.
*   **Eight Puzzle:** Solves the Eight Puzzle using heuristic search, calculating the Manhattan distance as the heuristic.

### Project 3: Adversarial Search (Game Playing)

This project delves into adversarial search techniques used in game playing:

*   **Minimax Algorithm:** Implements the Minimax algorithm, a decision-making algorithm for minimizing the possible loss in a worst-case scenario.
*   **Alpha-Beta Pruning:**  Implements Alpha-Beta Pruning, an optimization technique for the Minimax algorithm that reduces the number of nodes evaluated in the search tree.
*   **Game Implementation (e.g., Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect Four):**  Applies the Minimax algorithm and Alpha-Beta Pruning to a specific game (the actual game implemented might vary).

### Project 4: Genetic Algorithms

This project explores genetic algorithms for optimization problems:

*   **N-Queens Problem (Genetic):** Solves the N-Queens problem using a genetic algorithm.
*   **Function Optimization:**  Optimizes a mathematical function using a genetic algorithm.


## Build Instructions

These projects are written in Python and require a Python interpreter (Python 3.x recommended). To run a project:

1.  **Navigate:** Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory of the specific project you want to run (e.g., `Project 1`).
2.  **Run:** Execute the Python script using the command `python <script_name>.py` (replace `<script_name>` with the actual name of the Python file).

## Usage

Each project may have specific input requirements. Refer to the comments within the Python scripts for instructions on how to provide input and interpret the output.
